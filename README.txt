Region mod for the Iterator OC Three Stars Above Clouds, by DeltaOrionis.

To install, extract files and place the mod folder in \Steam\steamapps\common\Rain World\RainWorld_Data\StreamingAssets\mods. Then, enable in Rain World's Remix menu.

VERY unfinished and extremely subject to change. Currently contains four regions: TS (Three Stars Above Clouds), TX (Exalted Exterior), PS (Pump Station), and ZN (Zenith).

TS is the most complete, but is still in its very early draft stages. Many rooms are missing sounds and effects. TX is about 50% drafted and contains many blank placeholder rooms. PS and ZN basically contain nothing but a few test rooms. I don't know if I'm going to expand on those two anytime soon.

This mod does not connect to any Vanilla or DLC regions, and I do not intend for it to. The only way to access it is through the Warp mod. If you would like to explore it organically, I recommend loading into the room TS_A01 first.

There is a puppet, but it has very little dialogue and currently only reads white pearls. Initial dialogue is buggy if the player does not already have the Mark of Communication. (You can give yourself the Mark by using the Dev Console mod: type "the_mark".)

This mod has not been thoroughly playtested. While not required, I would recommend enabling invulnerability through a mod like Dev Console to avoid giving yourself a headache.

Does not require the Watcher DLC, but some palettes are incompatible with The Watcher and this mod must be placed above The Watcher in the Remix menu or the wrong palettes will be loaded. I will fix this in a future update.

I am also aware that a few of the region acronyms have already been taken by the modding community. This is something I will try to remedy this in the future.
