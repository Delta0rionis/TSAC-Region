<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl contains a number of crude mathematical proofs<LINE>and incomplete exercises. Only a couple of them are correct.<LINE>A child’s discarded schoolwork, perhaps.:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl records an astrological chart, prepared for members<LINE>of the House of Moons residing in Living Block 254. It appears<LINE>someone was trying to make predictions about their family’s future.<LINE>Purely baseless, if you ask me.:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This is an... impression of the night sky, as viewed through portions <LINE>of the infrared spectrum not visible to the eye. An interesting piece of <LINE>speculative art... though, the artist’s interpretation of <LINE>infrared light is rather fanciful.:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl is a bulletin containing significant dates throughout <LINE>the cyclical year, indicating the times of important festivals and public holidays. <LINE>The city’s temples circulated these to keep the public informed of the event schedule, <LINE>there were quite a few of them...:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl contains a copy of memoranda passed between members of <LINE>my city's High Council. They are full of heated political debates <LINE>and rather vulgar insults aimed at oppositional parties... <LINE>I won’t repeat them here.:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl... is addressed to me. The author is attempting to persuade <LINE>me to move Celestial Spheres in their favor... something I obviously cannot do. <LINE>This was most likely an offering left at one of the city’s temples. <LINE>I was not meant to read this directly; it was likely more of a symbolic <LINE>gesture meant to bring good fortune.:20
<NextRandomLine>1:Ah... the crystal lattice structure of this pearl is damaged beyond repair. <LINE>What a shame...:10
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl contains a series of instructions relating to the handling <LINE>of domesticated Box Worms. Members of the species were used for many <LINE>industrial purposes, and were notoriously difficult to handle.:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl contains a delivery confirmation for a shipment of a gas-enriched <LINE>species of algae, cultivated from a hydroponics plant on the surface. <LINE>The oxygen in these plants was an essential resource, used to aid in altitude acclimation.:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This is weather report from an automated station at the base of the mountain. <LINE>Nothing out of the ordinary.:10
<NextRandomLine>1:This is an automated error log produced by some faulty machinery. With no engineers <LINE>left to fix them, these errors are unfortunately very common.:10
<NextRandomLine>1:This appears to be a draft of a scholar's thesis. It is clearly incomplete... <LINE>but the analysis of fifth-dimensional karmic transform geometry in regards <LINE>to the movement of Globular Cluster K57 is quite impressive...:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl contains an almanac of the movement of the Spheres from Cycle 471. <LINE>I already have these measurements in my archives... there is little else <LINE>in this pearl that interests me.:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This is a recipe... involving the use of fried Lilypuck and nectar. Despite being <LINE>edible, bioluminescent Lilypucks were also often used to light the city at night! <LINE>I wonder if there are any left...:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This contains meeting notes from a congregation of one of the lesser Councils. It appears <LINE>they spent this meeting discussing local zoning laws. Very mundane.:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl is too faded to read... likely due to being left out in the sun. <LINE>Repairing the crystal lattice structure would take me longer than <LINE>you are willing to wait, I think.:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This is a set of instructions for preparing a drink, one believed to contain <LINE>hallucinogenic properties. These were popular during festivals and ceremonies. <LINE>The drink apparently had a reputation for being sickeningly sweet.:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl is... well, to be honest I’m not sure. It contains an infinitely-looping <LINE>set of qualia based on a fractal pattern. It may be intended to hypnotize the reader <LINE>into a trance... for what reason is unclear. Regardless, it has no effect on me.:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl contains an old set of astronomical logs. Nothing I haven’t seen before.:10
<NextRandomLine>1:This contains research notes, written in shorthand. Without context this doesn’t mean much.:10
<NextRandomLine>1:This appears to be a diary entry. The author seems to be worried about an upcoming exam.:10
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl contains a set of astronomical data automatically generated by some of my observational <LINE> equipment. I already have this data stored in my long-term memory, so this pearl is redundant.:10
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl appears to have been tampered with... the data is scrambled and unreadable.:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This is a set of different infinite number series... pearls such as these were probably used as cipher keys.:10
<NextRandomLine>1:This is a blueprint for some spectrographic equipment, likely intended to be attached to a small telescope.
:10
<NextRandomLine>1:This is a schematic for one of the water retention dams at the base of the mountain. <LINE>They were designed to last a very long time... but they are unfortunately <LINE>not indestructible.:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This is a blueprint for one of my facility’s many anti-gravity water pumps. <LINE>It takes a lot of effort to pump water up from the base of <LINE>the mountain! These ones are quite powerful.:20
<NextRandomLine>1:How disappointing... this pearl seems to have been defaced by a scavenger, <LINE>rendering the data within unreadable. Such pests...
:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl is completely blank. Perhaps I can use it to store some of my astronomical data... thank you!:10
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl has nothing written on it. I can use this, thank you. Do you mind if I keep it?:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl is completely blank... aside from the number “10”. How odd.:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl has sustained several hairline fractures, but some of the data is still <LINE>readable... it appears to contain plain text, written in a very fanciful style. Perhaps it is an <LINE>excerpt from a novel.:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl contains a picture... of the Grand Planetarium in the city! Perhaps this was a memento, or a souvenir intended for a tourist.:10
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl is unreadable, I apologize.:10
<NextRandomLine>1:...oh. I do not want to discuss the contents of this pearl. Take it away.:10
<NextRandomLine>1:This is a telemetry log from a citizen ID drone. Its owner appears to have been very busy; <LINE>in a single cycle they travelled up and down the city's central spires a total of six times!:20
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl contains a set of light curves from stars in the Mother constellation. <LINE>Interesting... but I doubt you would get anything out of it.:10
<NextRandomLine>1:This is an old maintenance log from one of my observatories. Nothing of note worth mentioning...:10
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl is cracked, rendering it unreadable. I apologize.:10
<NextRandomLine>1:Unfortunately, exposure to excessive sunlight has faded this pearl's data to the point of being unreadable.:10
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl contains perfectly valid data, but it appears to be encrypted. <LINE>I could attempt to crack the encryption, but that would likely be a waste of both my time and yours.:10
<NextRandomLine>1:Ah... it seems this pearl has been deliberately damaged, likely by a scavenger. <LINE>How disrespectful.:10
<NextRandomLine>1:Scratches on this pearl's surface make it hard for me to read... <LINE>It appears to contain a list of materials used in manufacturing. <LINE>This may be an invoice of some sort.:20
<NextRandomLine>1:...oh. The contents of this pearl appear to be rather personal. I won't repeat them out loud.:10
<NextRandomLine>1:This pearl is blank... perhaps I can find some use for it.:10
